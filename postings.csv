You take user trust incredibly seriously and are always proactive about protecting potentially confidential data.

Experience with HIPAA compliant infrastructure At Aware Healthcare you can expect much more than just a competitive hourly rate. Here are some of the many benefits you can expect as part of your Co-Op experience: Early-stage startup experience: you'll get in on the ground floor of a new digital healthcare company and experience true innovation first-hand. Portfolio projects: you'll be given the freedom, trust, and resources you need to own projects from start to finish that directly impact people's lives. Summer case study: at the end of the program, we'll help you create/publish a case study showcasing your summer projects for future employers (here's an example (https://medium.com/the-mission/deconstructing-data-science-breaking-the-complex-craft-into-its-simplest-parts-15b15420df21)). Letter of recommendation: by the end of the summer, your direct supervisor will write a personal letter of recommendation for you to use in future job applications. Future job referrals: for months after your Co-Op, you'll have exclusive access to work opportunities that arise in our groups' 300+ company network. Professional mentorship: you'll receive direct training, guidance, and oversight from a supervisor who has 5+ years of experience in your chosen field of work. Networking opportunities: you'll meet and work alongside incredibly smart, driven, and resourceful teammates; build relationships that last your whole career. Real impact: you'll walk away from the summer with having positively influenced the trajectory of people in recovery, and tangible work products that prove it. Aware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most. The current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time. With our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare. We envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare. We are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital health companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore. Join us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare.  We're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges. You should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively. This is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you. Being on the Aware Healthcare team means you... Take ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible. Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen. Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes. Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism. Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'. Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied. Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn. Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine. Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings. Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions.",Software Engineer,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=a80a94ce7bb56c8e&fccid=ee1dc6ee52d6b443&vjs=3,12.0
