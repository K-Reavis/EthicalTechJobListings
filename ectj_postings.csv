TJFG,Engineer,Software Engineer,MoveOn,"Atlanta, GA",http://techjobsforgood.com/jobs/3724/,,"Full-time Starts ASAP Competitive Nonprofit Pay Excellent Benefits Work from Anywhere in the Continental U.S. Software Engineer or Senior Software Engineer: We are open to hiring a Software Engineer or Senior Software Engineer, so please apply to this posting even if you believe you may be overqualified. Apply here: https://grnh.se/f5c74cd41us Application deadline: Application deadline is Saturday August 8th at 5pm ET. About MoveOn MoveOn is a diverse and vibrant community of millions of people working together to create progressive change in America. We are an innovative campaigning organization of 90-odd folks that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, shape the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what\u2019s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive. MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement that will give voters something to vote for, not just against\u2014and we're also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2020 and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact. To enable this work, we are hiring a passionate problem-solver who will take our technology platform to the next level. Join our team! Together, we will brainstorm, collaborate, design, build, and ship code that runs at massive scale. About MoveOn\u2019s Systems MoveOn\u2019s millions of members generate significant website and digital tool traffic that creates interesting scaling problems to solve. We have terabytes of data that drive ambitious analytics, fundraising, and engagement programs. At MoveOn, making decisions with data is a core part of how all work gets done. Like many nonprofit tech teams, we're a small, scrappy crew, wear many hats, and work across the software stack and across the organization. We work closely with fundraisers, multi-channel campaigners, field organizers, analysts, and storytellers to implement and scale their ambitious plans. While we often split up who is working on which projects, everyone on the team works on all parts of our systems. We have ~10 production systems\u2014and two systems running at significant scale\u2014getting thousands of requests a minute during spikes of member energy. We believe in choosing the best language, platform, and tool for the job and are not language zealots, but we also recognize the switching cost of straddling too many languages. We do a lot of work in Python and Javascript and deploy most systems to AWS (check out our GitHub) but believe good programmers don\u2019t need to come in with an exact match of experience and can learn our systems and software stacks. We are deeply collaborative and spend lots of time pair-programming over Zoom video. We have a \u201cthere are no silly questions\u201d policy and encourage egoless collaboration. We build and maintain infrastructure that powers the organization and amplifies the work of the analytics and mobile teams. We\u2019ve created software management processes that let us work in a flexible, all-remote environment and empower us to embed with organizers and work on tight political deadlines.

Apply here: https://grnh.se/f5c74cd41us Application deadline: Application deadline is Saturday August 8th at 5pm ET. About MoveOn MoveOn is a diverse and vibrant community of millions of people working together to create progressive change in America. We are an innovative campaigning organization of 90-odd folks that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, shape the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what’s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive. MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement that will give voters something to vote for, not just against—and we're also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2020 and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact. To enable this work, we are hiring a passionate problem-solver who will take our technology platform to the next level. Join our team! Together, we will brainstorm, collaborate, design, build, and ship code that runs at massive scale. About MoveOn’s Systems MoveOn’s millions of members generate significant website and digital tool traffic that creates interesting scaling problems to solve. We have terabytes of data that drive ambitious analytics, fundraising, and engagement programs. At MoveOn, making decisions with data is a core part of how all work gets done. Like many nonprofit tech teams, we're a small, scrappy crew, wear many hats, and work across the software stack and across the organization. We work closely with fundraisers, multi-channel campaigners, field organizers, analysts, and storytellers to implement and scale their ambitious plans. While we often split up who is working on which projects, everyone on the team works on all parts of our systems. We have ~10 production systems—and two systems running at significant scale—getting thousands of requests a minute during spikes of member energy. We believe in choosing the best language, platform, and tool for the job and are not language zealots, but we also recognize the switching cost of straddling too many languages. We do a lot of work in Python and Javascript and deploy most systems to AWS (check out our GitHub) but believe good programmers don’t need to come in with an exact match of experience and can learn our systems and software stacks. We are deeply collaborative and spend lots of time pair-programming over Zoom video. We have a “there are no silly questions” policy and encourage egoless collaboration. We build and maintain infrastructure that powers the organization and amplifies the work of the analytics and mobile teams. We’ve created software management processes that let us work in a flexible, all-remote environment and empower us to embed with organizers and work on tight political deadlines.

TJFG,Research,Director of Infrastructure Engineering,Nava,Remote,http://techjobsforgood.com/jobs/3604/,,"Nava is working to improve government services for vulnerable populations. Some of our least visible but most impactful and far-reaching efforts involve modernizing and improving the foundational infrastructure that government agencies depend on to provide services. \nAs we grow into larger, more sophisticated infrastructure projects that serve tens of millions of Americans, we're looking for an Infrastructure Director to round out our existing senior engineering leadership team. Job Description We're currently looking for a Director of Infrastructure to assure the foundations for federal and state government services are robust, dependable, and maintainable for decades to come.\nYou are a thoughtful and empathetic engineer motivated by providing usable solutions that help people. You're organized, collaborative, and care about both technology and the engineers you'll be leading. You have experience in coordinating across multiple teams with different tech stacks, architectures, and stakeholders. You have a broad knowledge of what infrastructure tools exist and recognize that each project / problem has its own challenges and technical needs. You have the patience and problem-solving enthusiasm to refactor and integrate with legacy systems and services. Coaching your teams on how to think about a whole system and choose the most impactful improvement and automation will be a large part of your contribution. Your leadership will help us better serve the people who use government services, the needs of the agencies we work with, and the changes we can make to have a large and lasting impact. Though there may be some opportunities to be hands-on and direct the specific approaches your teams use, your preference should be guiding your teams to make good choices (and follow through on implementing them) You can work remotely, or work from one of Nava\u2019s offices in DC, SF, or NYC.  Opportunities and Challenges Nava provides opportunities to do meaningful, impactful, mission-oriented work. As a public benefit corporation, we have a social mission written into our founding charter. The people who work at Nava have a fiduciary duty to our stated mission: to improve access, effectiveness, and simplicity of government services. We see this as an opportunity, but it is also important to highlight the challenges we face in advance. You will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working with government employees, other government contractors, and civil servants. Working with people outside of Nava means you'll likely encounter different working styles, cultural norms and be responsible for maintaining order and focus without authority.  The government contracting ecosystem is a compliance-driven multi-stakeholder environment \u2013 particularly when compared to the operating environments for companies of our size in the private sector. Successful members of our team understand how to be innovative within this environment. Finding and recommending ways to improve the ways in which government digital services are procured and built is one of the highest-leverage ways we fulfill our mission. What you'll do You'll work closely with the VP of Engineering and other Directors to shape Nava's technical direction and vision as we grow into new sectors to improve services for additional populations. You'll collaborate across functional departments (Engineering, Design, Delivery, and Product) to build scalable, consistent workflows and processes. In concert with Program Management, you'll be an escalation point for misalignments between engineering, delivery, and product priorities and decisions. You'll lead your team in implementing infrastructure best practices, assure they're exposed to new tools and technologies, and provide heuristics on how to assess the best tool for a given problem. Much of your team comes from a background that doesn't include professional services or client management responsibilities. You'll build processes and best practices for how to engage effectively and professionally with clients and other stakeholders. Coaching and teaching others is a critical aspect of this role. You'll directly manage our infrastructure engineering managers/tech leads, and will actively engage in promoting and supporting growth for infrastructure engineers at all levels. Strategize and coordinate infrastructure staffing and hiring with our Program Management, Staffing, and Recruiting teams. Manage a team of 3-7 managers across multiple projects (currently 3) Develop and refine equitable practices and cultivate a diverse and effective team, helping them realize their potential and honoring each team member's unique experiences. Seek support from champions within Nava or amongst clients, especially in the digital transformation space, where there is anticipated resistance to new practices or decisions. Provide air-cover for direct reports on any contract (e.g. scrubbing in to help get a project on track or providing direct support if your team encounters a complex stakeholder management situation) What we're looking for Interest in improving government services. Broad background in infrastructure and an interest in using the best tools to solve a given problem. Experience successfully leading multiple projects across multiple teams, and growing individual members of those teams in an equitable manner. Ability to graciously accept, and give, feedback to both reports and executive management. Strong communication skills - able to 'meet people where they are' and successfully coordinate and communicate to other engineers, product managers, delivery managers, design leads, and program managers. Ability and interest in teaching teams how to solve problems, as opposed to dictating solutions (but able to dictate solutions if the team needs that support) Experience cultivating strong relationships with external clients, stakeholders, customers or partners. Experience with fast-growing companies, with a bonus for experience within government contracting or professional service firms. Other Requirements: Experience:  8+ years of experience in Infrastructure, including experience with Cloud Infrastructure,  CI/CD, Operations, Infrastructure Automation. 3+ years of direct people management experience and team leadership. You will have a direct impact on the technical direction and success of Nava. We are stewards \u2013 we hold a deep responsibility towards the systems that we work with. We are a community \u2013 we value collaboration both within our teams and with the many hardworking people within government. We offer generous benefits and equity. Remote states Nava is actively hiring in: California, DC, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington. If you are not living in one of the states listed above, unfortunately, you will not be considered for a position at this time.

Summer case study: at the end of the program, we'll help you create/publish a case study showcasing your summer projects for future employers (here's an example (https://medium.com/the-mission/deconstructing-data-science-breaking-the-complex-craft-into-its-simplest-parts-15b15420df21)).

Aware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most. The current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time. With our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare. We envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare. We are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital health companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore. Join us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare. We're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges. You should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively. This is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you. Being on the Aware Healthcare team means you... Take ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible. Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen. Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes. Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism. Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'. Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied. Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn. Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine. Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings. Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions. ",2020-08-24

TJFG,Engineer,Software Engineer,Bowery Farming,"New York, NY",http://techjobsforgood.com/jobs/3796/,,"At Bowery Farming, we dream of a world where agriculture gives back to the people and the planet more than it takes. But to achieve this, we need more than incremental change. We need to reimagine farming from the ground up. Everyday, Bowery\u2019s purpose-driven team works toward this mission. Right outside of cities, we build indoor farms that grow wildly flavorful produce that\u2019s defiantly free from pollutants, all while using less finite resources like space and water. Our smart farms are powered by our proprietary farm operating system, BoweryOS, creating a simplified, agile food system that\u2019s focused on flavor, freshness, and safety. At Bowery, we\u2019re farming efficiently so we can feed effectively, democratizing access to fresh, local food in our communities. About the Role: This is an opportunity to join a growing team and make a substantial impact at Bowery. We\u2019re looking for someone that can learn, adapt and roll with a fast-paced, ever-changing environment and who isn\u2019t afraid of uncertainty.  Software Engineering at Bowery involves developing software systems that power a modern farm.  This includes building out work management systems, data collection, visualization, control systems, and farm automation. You\u2019ll be part of idea generation, design, prototyping, planning, and the execution of new software components of all aspects of our farms. The software stack at Bowery consists of a few, focused Elixir services running in AWS, Phoenix + Vue.js / React on the front-end, and Elixir (Nerves) running on thousands of in-house built devices on-premise in our farms. We're utilizing an event-driven architecture, RPC, and Channels/WebSockets to pass data throughout our services and real-time UI's. What You\u2019ll Do: Create innovative automation solutions and advance the state of indoor farming alongside mechanical engineers, agricultural scientists, and the farm operations team. Build responsive, mobile-first web applications to support the demands of farm operations and agricultural science teams. Develop systems to collect, process, and visualize data related to plant health and growing environment characteristics. Optimize crop cycles and workflow schedules to improve yields and make the best use of time in the farm. Scale systems to handle more farms, more sensors, more crops, and more operators. Who You Are: You have experience developing and scaling production web applications using Phoenix, Rails, Node, or similar backend MVC frameworks. You proactively mitigate issues through test-driven development, continuous deployment, and thoughtful monitoring and alerting. You\u2019ve built user interfaces using JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, React, or Angular. You\u2019ve used implementations of protocols like MQTT, XMPP, and AMQP to handle messaging between services in a distributed system. You\u2019re excited about how advancements in machine learning and IoT can work in harmony to improve the state of the planet. You are able to establish scope of assigned tasks, execute on them, and independently communicate status updates. You participate in code reviews and give constructive feedback to peers You believe that teams succeed and fail together and take responsibility for ensuring the success and safety of your teammates. You\u2019re confident taking ownership of projects from start to finish and enjoy the process of turning nebulous ideas into reality. Bowery's headquarters are based in Manhattan. We have two farms in Kearny, New Jersey. One farm is focused on Research & Development, the other services retailers and community partners in the Tri-State area.
